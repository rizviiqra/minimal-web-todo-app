# Project: Minimal Web Todo App

## Overview
**Brief:** Create a single-page To-Do List application. It must allow adding and deleting tasks. Tasks must be stored using the browsers localStorage API to persist between sessions.

This application was automatically generated by an **LLM-assisted development pipeline** and deployed to GitHub Pages. It is designed to be a fully compliant solution for the stated requirements.

## Technical Details

### Development Status (Round 1)
The current iteration of the code is the result of **Round 1** of development.

### Technologies Used
The application is a single-page website (`index.html`) using **pure HTML, embedded CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It relies on modern browser features (and optionally minimal CDNs) and requires no build steps or external package managers.

---

## Functional Requirements
The application successfully addresses the following core functional and structural checks:

- The page contains an input field and an Add button.
- Tasks are added to a list below the input.
- Tasks can be deleted using a button next to them.
- A successful task is visible when the page is reloaded (persistence check).
