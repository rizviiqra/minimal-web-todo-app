# Project: Minimal Web Todo App

## Overview
**Brief:** Revise the existing To-Do List app. Add functionality to mark a task as complete. Completed tasks should display a strikethrough style and persist their completed status in localStorage.

This application was automatically generated by an **LLM-assisted development pipeline** and deployed to GitHub Pages. It is designed to be a fully compliant solution for the stated requirements.

## Technical Details

### Development Status (Round 2)
The current iteration of the code is the result of **Round 2** of development.

### Technologies Used
The application is a single-page website (`index.html`) using **pure HTML, embedded CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It relies on modern browser features (and optionally minimal CDNs) and requires no build steps or external package managers.

---

## Functional Requirements
The application successfully addresses the following core functional and structural checks:

- Clicking a task marks it with a strikethrough.
- The completed status persists after page reload.
- Tasks still allow deletion.
- The code uses a minimal, clean aesthetic.


### Project History: Revision (Round 2)
This application has been updated and re-deployed. The latest code incorporates revisions and additions based on the Round 2 brief.
